					I like numbers, surfaces, spaces, and their manifestations in physical systems and data.

					I am a recent graduate of Harvard College (May 2018, physics and mathematics) currently based in New York City working in data science and software development. I work in Python to build machine learning models at scale in Spark, and I build fast concurrent systems in Go.

						As an undergraduate in physics and math, I had the greatest appreciation for physical systems as manifestations of group theory- for example, how physical operators and states can form representations of particular Lie algebras. Now, working to build ML models to work with images (simple computer vision), I enjoy reading about embeddings and appreciating how convnets perform meaningful embeddings from a high-dimensional real space to a lower-dimensional real space, and keeping up with what's being published recently.

						During my time as an undergraduate I also had the pleasure of teaching as a course assistant for a first-year linear algebra and multivariable calculus course. It was a meaningful learning experience for me especially with minimal experience in teaching- I had personally tutored before, but I quickly came to realize a larger class is quite the different environment- and having been given the opportunity to craft my own weekly hour-long classes around the course material. In the spirit of the notes I created for the students while a course assistant, I'll be starting something of a blog here on various topics in machine learning- optimization, embeddings, etc. Posts yet to come- this website itself is just starting!
